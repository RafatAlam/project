\# CS180-Project
Project Motivation: 

Traditional chess is a game of pure strategy and skill, but it can also feel static and predictable after years of play. Our team wanted to create a modern twist that keeps the intellectual depth of chess but adds unpredictable elements that make every match unique.  We’re all interested in game design and web development. This project gives us a perfect opportunity to explore those skills while building something that’s both fun and technically challenging. The addition of random power-ups appearing on the chessboard introduces a fresh layer of strategy, encouraging players to adapt their plans and think creatively. The goal is to develop a site where users can log in, play against others, play against predetermined problems, and customize their profiles, all through an interactive, browser based interface.

Functional Requirements:
1. Playable Chess Game
Players can start a new game against a friend or a local opponent.
Chessboard follows standard movement and rules. Power-ups appear randomly on the board every few turns.
If a piece moves onto a power-up square, that power-up activates for a limited time.

2. User Accounts and Profiles
Players can create an account, log in, and edit basic profile info.
Stored data includes username, password, and profile picture.
Players can view their past games and basic stats (wins/losses).

3. Power-Up System
The system randomly spawns power-ups during a match
Power-ups disappear if not collected within a few turns to keep gameplay balanced

4. Match Creation and Basic Matchmaking
Create private matches via sharable links or join a waiting lobby.
Turn-based flow with clear UI prompts for whose move it is.

6. Basic Leaderboard and Profile View
After each game, results are saved.
